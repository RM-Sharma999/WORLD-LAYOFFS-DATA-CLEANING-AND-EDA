## GLOBAL LAYOFFS (Starting From March 2020)

# Background
Considering the recent layoffs in big tech companies and various other sectors, many questions arised in my mind with regards to the cause and effects of this problem. In order to uncover the insights to this Layoff Trend, I decided to do a bit of Exploratory data analysis on the World Layoffs dataset from Kaggle.com and found out that tens of thousands of people have lost jobs across 57 countries, 2586 companies and 31 industries starting from the year 2020 to the current yeat 2024.
